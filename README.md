## 🖥️ Operational Guide

1. **Locate Target CSS Selector:** Navigate to your preferred e-commerce item window. Right-click the price tag text and choose **Inspect**. Identify its structural HTML token string class (e.g., `.price-tag-value` or `#item-price`).
2. **Register a Product Tracking Task:** Populate the UI submission fields with the Item Name, Product Page URL, extracted CSS Selector token, and your designated budget Target Price limit.
3. **Monitor Price Shifts:** Code Quest will instantly run its initial parse and register records inside your local tracked panel view. The background worker thread updates these fields continuously.
